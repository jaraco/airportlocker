2.0
===

The upload module has been revamped to provide a much simpler interface for
uploading multiple files to airportlocker (for Gryphon-specific usage).
Otherwise, the library remains completely backwards-compatible.

1.0
===

The version was bumped to 1.0 to indicate the backward incompatibility in the
removed faststore migration. The application should otherwise be
backward-compatible with all 0.x versions (or at least recent ones).

* Faststore migration removed.
* Completed implementation of GridFS backend. Enable by adding to the config::

    storage_class: airportlocker.lib.gridfs:GridFSStorage

0.11
====

* Added support for Velociraptor-based deployment.
* Removed dependency on pmxtools.
