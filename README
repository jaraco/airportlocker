airportlocker
=============

Media resource storage for YouGov apps. Uses MongoDB for storage of metadata
and provides two backends for configurable storage of the file payload (either
in MongoDB or on the filesystem).

Stores all media with versions where the resource URI is unchanging for
a given resource.

You can consume the API using XMLHttpRequest since we include Access-Control-Allow headers.
